The code herein was from http://www.opencores.org


RUNNING BENCHMARKS

cd sim
make machine
     # This will output information about the machine.
     # If you submit results back, you need to include this output.
make (simulator-name)

It will automatically determine the base time for a 1 cycle simulation,
then keep increasing the cycle count until a resonable estimate has been
made.  The final output will look like this:

****Final: Verilator VERSION    COMMAND   1438800 cycles/second


SUBMITTING RESULTS

If you submit results you must send in the complete output, including the
output of "make machine".  If the "lshw" command fails, and you can't
install it, please describe your system model and characteristics.
